/**
 * A shopkeeper has a sale to complete and has arranged the items being sold in a list.
 * Starting from the left, the shop keeper rings up each item at its full price less the price of the first lower or equally priced item to its right.
 * If there is no item to the right that costs less than or equal to the current item's price the current item is sold at full price.
 *
 * Assumptions
 * The first and second items would each be discounted by 1 unit, the first equal or lower price to the right.
 * The item priced 1 unit would sell at a full price.
 * The next item, at 2 units, would be discounted 2 units as would the 4 unit item.
 * The sixth and final item must be purchased at full price.
 *
 * Input
 * The input consists of one arguments:
 * items_prices : a list of integers representing the price of items
 *
 * Output
 * return total cost of all items on the first line and on the second line print a space separated list of integers representing the indexes of the non- discounted items in ascending index order.
 * Constraints
 * 1 <= size(prices) <= 100000
 * 1 <= prices <= 1000000
 *
 * Examples
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input:
 * items_prices = [2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 2]
 * Output:
 * 18
 * 2 5
 * Explanation:
 * The total cost is 1+2+1+0+2+2 = 8 units. And 2 and 5 indexes has no discount.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input:
 * items_prices = [5, 1, 3, 4, 6, 2]
 * Output:
 * 14
 * 1 5
 *
 *
 * Example 3:
 * Input:
 * items_prices = [1, 3, 3, 2, 5]
 * Output:
 * 9
 * 0 3 4
